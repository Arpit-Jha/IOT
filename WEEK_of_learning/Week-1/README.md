In IOT both software and hardware are equally important. In first week of our IOT journey we are going to learn about basic circuit building and few key components required in circuit designing.  
for connecting different components we generally use wires, but as complexity of project increases the circuit wires become messy and we cannot keep track of them. therefore we use some kind of board to make connections neater.  
we can use three types of boards for connections on basis of refinement we need in our project:  
1. BreadBoard
2. PerfBoard
3. Printed Circuit Board
